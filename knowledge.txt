Q:How do I upload a document?
A:To upload a document, click the ‘Upload’ button, select your file from your device, and click ‘Open’. Alternatively, you can drag and drop your documents directly into the Import Queue.

Q:Can I drag and drop files into the system?
A:Yes, you can drag and drop files directly into the upload area by dragging your file from your device and dropping it into the designated import queue area.

Q:What file types can I upload?
A:Samantha supports the following file types: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, & PDFs.

Q:Can I upload multiple documents at once?
A:Yes, you can upload multiple documents simultaneously by selecting all the files you wish to upload and clicking ‘Open’.

Q:How do I delete a document from the queue?
A:To delete a document from the import queue:

1. Scroll right in the import queue to locate the column with X icons.

2. Click the X next to the document you want to delete, then confirm the deletion.

Q:Can I delete more than one document from the queue?
A:To delete multiple documents at once:

1. Select the checkbox next to each document in the Import Queue panel on the left.

2. Click the red Delete button at the top.

Q:What happens if I delete the wrong document?
A:If you delete the wrong document, don’t worry. Scroll down in the Import Queue panel on the left and click on the "Recycle Bin" tab. From there, you can view deleted documents and restore them back to the queue.

Q:Can I recover a deleted document?
A:Yes, simply scroll down the import queue panel on the left and find the "Recycle Bin" tab. There you can view deleted documents and restore them to the import queue.

Q:What is the Import Queue?
A:The Import Queue is where documents await review by the receptionist within Samantha. These documents remain in Samantha (not Best Practice) until imported.

Q:What is Auto Bulk Import and how do I use it?
A:Auto Bulk Import allows you to import all documents marked as ‘verified’ with a single click.

Q:Can I choose where the document goes?
A:Yes. Before uploading, users typically select the inbox type either Doctor’s Inbox or Patient File. Samantha recommends or fills in the user/doctor, but this can be overridden manually to assign the document to the desired doctor’s inbox.

Q:How do I review a document before finalizing it?
A:Select the document in the Import Queue to view it in the central panel. Required filing fields for Best Practice appear on the right and can be manually overridden.

Q:What is Semi-Automatic import mode?
A:Semi-Automatic mode requires the user to click ‘Auto Bulk Import’ to allocate all documents marked ‘verified’.

Q:What is Fully Automatic import mode?
A:In Fully Automatic mode, all ‘verified’ documents uploaded to Samantha are directly imported into the Best Practice PMS without manual review.

Q:What does “Data Review Needed” mean?
A:This status indicates that information extracted by Samantha requires manual verification before finalization to be allocated.

Q:What’s the difference between “Doctor’s Inbox” and “Patient File”?
A:Doctor’s Inbox holds documents for doctor review before forwarding to the Patient File. Documents imported directly to the Patient File bypass doctor review and go straight into the patient’s record.

Q:How do I assign a document to the right destination?
A:Samantha uses advanced semantic analysis based on extensive training to assign documents according to clinic preferences. However, users can override any field during review by selecting the desired store-in destination from a dropdown menu.

Q:How do I enable/disable users or doctors in the system?
A:To manage users or doctors who are inactive but still appear in Best Practice, go to Advanced Settings > Doctors. Here, you can deselect those no longer active.

Q:What is “Patient x User” matching?
A:Patient x User matching is one of three verification types Samantha uses to confirm a document. It checks whether the patient on the document has had a recent appointment with the doctor or user listed, based on appointment history. “Recent” typically means within the last six months but can be adjusted by the practice manager.

Q:What is the user name toggle?
A:The user name toggle requires the user’s name to be verified for a document to be considered ‘verified’.

Q:Can I manage the doctors included for matching?
A:Yes. In ‘Advanced Settings’ under ‘Doctors’, you can select or deselect which doctors to include for matching—for example, to exclude inactive doctors who have left the practice.

Q:What are the forwarding groups?
A:Forwarding groups let clinics forward correspondence from one user to another. This is useful when a doctor leaves, is absent, or on vacation. You can manage this in Advanced Settings > Forwarding Groups by selecting the source user and the destination user for forwarding.

Q:What is store-in mapping?
A:Store-in mapping allows clinics to customize where categories of correspondence are stored in the Doctor’s Inbox. Clinics can use Care GP’s AI suggestions based on tested approaches or manually adjust categories by adding, dragging, and dropping to set preferred store-in locations. This gives clinics more control and flexibility.

Q:What happens after I upload a document?
A:Once you upload a document, Samantha automatically begins extracting key medical information from it.

Q:What do the symbols/tick icons mean?
A:For a comprehensive understanding of these symbols click on the question mark next to the Import Queue. A table will be displayed explaining the defintion of every icon.

Q:What’s the difference between “mandatory” and “secondary” patient identifiers?
A:Mandatory identifiers must be verified for patient verification. Secondary identifiers require a minimum number to be verified from a set. For example, if date of birth (DOB) is mandatory, verification requires it. If DOB and address are secondary with a minimum of one, verifying either is sufficient.

Q:Can Samantha verify handwritten documents?
A:Yes, Samantha supports uploading and verifying handwritten documents.

Q:What if a patient has changed their name recently?
A:Samantha cross-checks information from each page against the Best Practice Database. If a patient recently changed their name and it isn’t updated in the database, Samantha flags a ‘name mismatch’ and uses other identifiers like date of birth or Medicare number to verify the patient. If the clinic hasn’t updated the patient’s information, they will need to confirm and update it manually.

Q:What is “+Accept Recommendation”?
A:When Samantha cannot confidently verify a patient or doctor—due to missing or insufficient information—it highlights the entity with a yellow ring and recommends that the receptionist review and Accept Recommendation before proceeding.

Q:Why can’t I log in?
A:If you can’t log in, please check your email and password for accuracy and ensure your internet connection is stable. If the problem continues, contact our customer support team via the WhatsApp group for assistance.

Q:What happens if I close the browser during an upload?
A:If you close the browser during an upload, don’t worry. When you return, check the Import Queue to see if the file uploaded successfully. The upload and analysis run securely on the server, so your data remains safe and processing continues as long as the file was received.

Q:The documents are failing to upload.
A:Document upload failures can result from processing errors such as system rate limits, Best Practice errors, or backend issues. Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in. If the issue persists, use the "Report Processing Error" button or contact customer support via the WhatsApp group.

Q:Why wasn’t this document verified?
A:This document wasn’t verified because Samantha detected missing or incomplete fields in the extracted information.

Q:Why are my documents not importing?
A:Import failures often occur when required fields are missing or contain invalid data. Please verify all fields are correctly filled. Try refreshing the page or logging out and back in. If the problem remains, click the "Report Processing Error" button or contact customer support via the WhatsApp group.

Q:What does “backend fetch failed” mean?
A:“Backend fetch failed” indicates a problem during upload or import. This may be due to backend processing errors—such as API rate limits or data formatting issues—or import errors like missing fields, deleted patients/users, or an expired session. Please try re-uploading, refreshing the page, or logging back in. If the issue continues, use the "Report Processing Error" button or contact support via the WhatsApp group.

Q:What is CareGP and what does it do?
A: Care GP is an Australian health tech company dedicated to delivering AI-powered administrative support tools for general practice (GP) clinics. Its mission is to reduce the administrative workload so healthcare professionals can focus on delivering quality patient care.

Q:How do I accept my Care GP invite?

Q:How do I create a secure password?
To keep your account secure, we recommend creating a password with at least 12 characters, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Following best practices for password security is essential for protecting your online accounts.

Q:What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and why is it required?
A:Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security measure that requires two or more verification methods to access your account. Typically, this includes entering a code from a third-party app such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator. By requiring multiple forms of verification, Care GP significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access—even if your login credentials are compromised.

Q:I’m scanning the QR code, but it’s not working.
A:While it is very common to attempt scan the QR code with a normal phone camera, please make sure you download and open an Authenticator App, add a new service and scan the QR code through this.

Q:How do I download the Authenticator app?
A:To download an authenticator app, simply choose a free option like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy, or one from a password manager you already use (such as 1Password or LastPass), then search for it in the App Store if you're using an iPhone or in the Google Play Store if you're using an Android device, and tap "Install" to download it.

Q:Where do I find the 6-digit code to log in?
A:The six-digit verification code will appear in your authenticator app. Open the app on your device and look for the code under the service name you entered when setting up Samantha.

Q:I forgot my password—can I reset it?
A:If you forget your password, you can reset it either from within Samantha or before logging in. Click "Reset Password" and follow the prompts. You’ll receive an email from the Care GP team with a link to reset your password and regain access.

Q:How do I use Samantha?
A:After logging in, you'll be taken to the Samantha interface where you can begin uploading, reviewing, and importing documents.  A demonstration video is available here: https://www.loom.com/share/1ab58a23721746e9abf9b8248c6e5c83?t=1"

Q:Can I use Care GP on my tablet or phone?
A:Yes, Samantha is a mobile-responsive web application. While it may be accessible on a tablet or larger iPad, we recommend using a desktop or laptop for the best experience. Mobile phones typically have screens that are too small for smooth use.

Q:What internet browser should I use? Does it matter?
A:You can use any browser you like, however, for the best performance, we recommend using Google Chrome if available to you.

Q:What should I see on the home screen after logging in?
A:After logging in, you’ll be taken to the Samantha interface where you can begin uploading and importing documents.

Q:How do I know the integration was successful?
A:Go to your account profile in the top right of the Samantha screen (typically with capital letters), then check to see if the Care GP Best Practice Integration is Live.

Q:What is Site verification?
A:Site verification is in place for security, integrity, and to support standardisation across all clinics using the Best Practice software. The Best Practice (BP) verification process requires clinics to provide their Site ID and cross check this alongside their Halo-Connect GUID as as method to achieve the following:

-To ensure secure integration with third-party providers
-To maintain compliance and auditability 
-To provide consistent support and traceability
-To protect the BP ecosystem from misuse or abuse

Q:Does site verifcation mean Best Practice has been integrated?
A:No, they are not the same. Site verification confirms that you have entered the correct Site ID and corresponding Halo GUID. However, to fully integrate with Best Practice (BP), you also need to enable Care GP within BP by going to Configurations > Databases > Third Party Integrations. Make sure Care GP is checked.

Q:Is my patient data safe when using Care GP?
A:Yes, Care GP is built with healthcare-grade data protection at its core. We use end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and localised cloud hosting to safeguard patient information. Our platform is independently certified to CyberCert Gold standards, and as a Best Practice Partner, we adhere to their rigorous security requirements.

Q:Does Care GP comply with Australian privacy laws?
A:Yes, Care GP complies with the Australian Privacy Act and the APPs. We exceed regulatory requirements through regular security audits, independent penetration testing, and strict data handling practices. Our infrastructure and processes align with both CyberCert Gold and Best Practice Partner Network standards.

Q:What does “data encryption” mean?
A:Data encryption is the process of converting information into a secure code to prevent unauthorised access. At Care GP, all patient data is encrypted using industry-standard protocols such as TLS, both during transmission and while stored.

Q:What is CyberCert Gold certification and why does it matter?
A:CyberCert Gold is an independent cybersecurity certification that confirms we meet advanced security and risk management standards. This includes assessments of our systems, access controls, and incident response readiness. It provides assurance that Care GP is held to some of the highest cybersecurity benchmarks in the healthcare industry.

Q:What is the difference between uploading and importing a document?
A:Uploading a document adds it to the Import Queue in Samantha, either by clicking the upload button or dragging and dropping the file. Importing a document involves reviewing it and allocating it to either a doctor’s inbox or a patient file in Best Practice. Uploaded documents stay in Samantha, while imported ones are sent to Best Practice.

Q: What is Corina?
A: Corina is Care GP's AI agent for handling inbound communications. She triages emails and can send documents to our other agents Samantha. Corina operates as a desktop application that automatically pulls documents from a local server folder (such as a Doctor's Inbox or Patient File) and forwards them to Samantha for allocation.

Q: How is Corina different from Samantha?
A: Corina manages inbound communications like emails and document intake, while Samantha focuses on allocating and importing those documents into Best Practice.

Q: What does “Auto Delete” do?
A: Auto Delete removes documents from the local folder they were uploaded or pulled from after they have been successfully allocated or imported into the Best Practice database, so admin staff don’t need to delete them manually.

Q: I'm confused. Is there an example video showing how to use Samantha?
A: Yes, here is a link to a demonstration of how to use Samantha: https://www.loom.com/share/1ab58a23721746e9abf9b8248c6e5c83?t=1

Q:How long is patient data kept?
A:Patient data is currently stored and encrypted on local databases within Australia. As Care GP continues to refine its data privacy and security policies, these practices will become more clearly defined. If you would like to specify how long encrypted data is stored, please contact the Care GP team to share your preferences.

Q:Why is a patient not matching even though their details are correct?
A:If a patient isn’t matching despite their details being correct, it’s possible they are not in the Best Practice database. If you’re confident the patient does exist, please click the “Report Processing Error” button next to the “Import Document” button to notify our team.

Q:The documents were not forwarded to a Dr.[specific doctor's name].
A:First, check that a forwarding rule has been correctly set up for the doctor in question. If the rule is in place and documents are still not being forwarded, please contact the Care GP team to report the issue.

Q:I can’t find the doctor I’m looking for.
A:Samantha pulls the full list of clinical and non-clinical users from Best Practice. If a particular doctor isn’t appearing in the dropdown, they may have been excluded from allocation—this can be checked and updated in the ‘Doctors’ section of the Advanced Settings. Alternatively, the doctor may no longer exist in Best Practice and cannot be fetched. If the issue persists after these checks, please contact the Care GP Customer Support team for further assistance.

Q:How do I install Corina?
A:To install Corina please follow the steps provided:

1. Download Corina
Click the provided download link to get the installer (.exe file). It will appear in your Downloads folder.

2. Locate Your Clinic Server
Use File Explorer to navigate to your clinic’s shared network location (e.g., Doctor’s Inbox or Patient Files). This is where you’ll store the installer so it’s accessible across devices.

3. Create or Find a Folder for Corina
In the shared area, locate or create a folder like “Corina” or “Software” to store the installer centrally.

4. Move the Installer to the Server
Copy the .exe file from your Downloads and paste it into the chosen shared folder.

5. Install Corina on the Server
Double-click the .exe file from the server folder and follow the installation steps. If prompted, approve security messages.

Q:How do I connect the right folders to Corina?
A:After logging into Corina, you’ll be prompted to set your Source and Archive folders in the main Corina interface. To maintain simplicity set the Source folder as the folder where the team currently places documents for review and upload. Usually, the archive folder is set up in the process of Corina in order to create a new, seperate folder where documents can be 'archived' after import. Ensure both folders are located on your shared network so the workflow is accessible to all staff.

Q: What is the Source Folder?
A:Where your team places documents (e.g., Doctor’s Inbox, Patient Files, or a Mixed folder). This is where Corina monitors for new files.

Q: What is the Archive Folder?
A:Where files are moved after upload. This should be a shared folder created by your team during setup.

Q:Corina is uploading multiple versions of the same document. What do I do?
A:Samantha includes a built-in de-duplication feature to help prevent the same document from being uploaded multiple times. This system checks both the file name and recent upload history (within the last 48 hours) to identify and skip duplicates.

If you're seeing multiple versions of the same document appear in Samantha, try the following:

1.Check the file name – If the document has been renamed or saved slightly differently (e.g., “report.pdf” vs “report (1).pdf”), it may bypass the de-duplication check.

2.Avoid manual re-saving – Saving or editing a document before upload may generate a new file signature, causing it to be treated as unique.

3.Contact Support – If the above steps don’t resolve the issue, please report it via the support panel within Samantha. Our team will investigate and ensure the de-duplication system is functioning as expected.

Q:Where are my files moved(by Corina)?
A:Files are moved to the Archive folder selected during setup. If no archive folder is selected, files will be deleted after upload to your clinical software (e.g., Best Practice). To avoid confusion and panic, we recommend setting up respective archive folders for your documents and linking these clearly during setup.

Q:Does using Samantha affect how I use Best Practice?
A:No, using Samantha does not change how you use Best Practice. It works alongside Best Practice by helping to allocate documents more efficiently, but all patient data and workflows remain within your existing system.

Q:What do I do if integration was set up but isn’t working?
A:If you are sure your Best Practice integration has been set up correctly and still isn’t functioning as expected, contact the Care GP support team for assistance.

Care GP does not provide discounts on its per month pricing however, does provide additional months free for customers that pay annually upfront. Additionally, we also run a referral program that grants any clinic that succesfully refers another site one free month
Referal program details
Objective:
To incentivise existing customers to refer new GP clinics to Care GP and reward them for growing the community.

How It Works:
When an existing customer refers a new site, they receive one month free of the product they’ve referred to (e.g., Samantha Document Manager).

If the referred site is paying less than 50% of the referring site's monthly cost, the bonus is pro-rated at 50%.

Referrals are only applicable to equivalent core products and exclude agents or add-ons introduced post-invoicing.

Rewards are unlocked after 3 consecutive months of successful payment from the referred site. If the referred site pays monthly, the reward is applied in month 4.If the referred site pays annually upfront, the reward is applied after the first month.

Rewards are redeemed as a free product month applied directly on the next invoice
